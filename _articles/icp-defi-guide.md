# ICP DeFi Guide

### A Beginners Guide to ICP DeFi

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), created by the DFINITY Foundation, is a groundbreaking blockchain that aims to decentralize not only financial services but the entire internet.

This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for beginners and intermediate users, focusing on the unique features of ICP DeFi, creating and securing an Internet Identity, managing tokens, and engaging with decentralized applications (dApps) within the ICP ecosystem.


## Getting Started with ICP DeFi

The following steps will guide you through the process of getting started with ICP DeFi, from acquiring ICP tokens to participating in decentralized finance on the Internet Computer.

### Step 1: Obtaining ICP Tokens

To begin your journey in ICP DeFi, the first step is to acquire ICP tokens, which are essential for performing transactions and interacting with dApps.

- **Purchase ICP Tokens**: You can purchase ICP tokens from centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. After acquiring the tokens, you will need to transfer them to an on-chain wallet within the Internet Computer ecosystem.

### Step 2: Creating an Internet Identity

Before you can manage your ICP tokens on-chain, you need to create an Internet Identity.

This is a crucial step, as it will be used to log in to various dApps, including the NNS frontend, where you manage your tokens.


This identity will serve as your gateway to all dApps on ICP.

- **Create Your Internet Identity**: Visit the [Internet Identity portal](https://identity.ic0.app/) using a supported device such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or hardware security key (e.g., Ledger). Follow the instructions to generate an anchor (your unique identity number), which will be securely tied to your device.
- **Best Practices for Securing Your Internet Identity**: After creating your Internet Identity, secure it by setting up a recovery method, such as a seed phrase or a hardware security key. This ensures that you can recover your Internet Identity if your device is lost or compromised.

    Always store your recovery seed phrase in a safe, offline location to prevent unauthorized access.


Internet Identity is not a Wallet, and does not have a wallet address like Principal ID to manage tokens. Internet Identity is a decentralized Identity service used for logging into dapps and wallets on ICP blockchain.

You can use Internet Identity to create a Principal ID (an address) on a wallet application where you can manage tokens.

### Step 3: Understanding Principal IDs

On the Internet Computer, each wallet is identified by a Principal ID—a unique string that acts as your identity on the blockchain.

Principal IDs can represent users, smart contracts (canisters), or nodes, enhancing privacy since different Principal IDs can be used across various applications.


Internet Identity generates a new principal on the Dapp you login with, so your wallet for each dapp will be unique, all controlled by your internet Identity. This ensures that the dapps can securely manage assets on their paltfrom and prevent malicious attacks across all dapps linked with your Identity.

This design prevents easy tracking of user activity.



### Step 4: Logging into the NNS Frontend DApp

Once your Internet Identity is set up, the next step is to log in to the Network Nervous System (NNS) frontend dApp.


NNS Front-End dapp is a fully on chain dapp and the first generic wallet of ICP network. But NNS is more than that.

This platform serves as your primary interface for managing ICP tokens, staking in neurons, and participating in governance.

- **Accessing the NNS Frontend**: Log in to the NNS frontend dApp using your Internet Identity. Upon logging in, the system will generate a Principal ID for you, which acts as your on-chain wallet address. This Principal ID is where you will receive the ICP tokens that you transfer from the centralized exchange.
- **Manage Your Tokens**: The NNS frontend allows you to manage a variety of tokens, including ICP, ckBTC (Bitcoin on ICP), ckETH (Ethereum on ICP), and SNS DAO tokens. Additionally, you can stake ICP and SNS DAO tokens in neurons to participate in governance, earning rewards for your contributions to the network.
- **DAO Interface and Voting**: The NNS frontend is not just a wallet; it is also a governance tool. By staking your ICP tokens, you can create neurons that allow you to vote on proposals, earning rewards and affecting the future of the Internet Computer. This decentralized governance model ensures that the network evolves according to the collective decisions of its users.

    **For Example:** You can use Neutrinite token $NTN to stake and vote on NTN DAO proposals via SNS Dashboard on NNS Front-end dapp. You can manage and vote on SNS DAOs via NNS Front end dapp.

If you are an experienced DeFi user, you can also use multiple wallets available on ICP Network. NNS is the first and end to end decentralized generic wallet dapp of ICP ecosystem.

### Step 5: Move your Tokens from CEX to On Chain

To start participating in DeFi activities on ICP, you will need to transfer your tokens from Centralized Exchange to On chain wallets.

That includes transfering tokens to NNS Front end and then to a Decentralized Exchange or sending them to a Decentralized Exchange directly.


Then you can do advanced DeFi activity via other applications

- **Choose a DEX**: The Internet Computer supports several DEXs, including Sonic, ICPswap, and ICDeX. Each platform offers different features, so choose the one that best suits your needs.
  
- **Transfer Tokens to the DEX**: After selecting a DEX, log in using your Internet Identity. 
  
  The DEX will generate a new Principal ID for you, which acts as your wallet address on that particular DEX platform.
  
  Transfer your ICP tokens from the NNS frontend to this DEX Principal ID to start trading or providing liquidity. You can also transfer your tokens directly from your Centralized Exchange account to DEX account you connected with Internet Identity, depending on your security needs.

### Step 6: Engaging in DeFi Activities on ICP

With your tokens now on chain, you can engage in various DeFi activities such as trading, liquidity provision, or staking.

- **Swap or Trade Tokens:** On the DEX, you can swap ICP tokens for other assets like ckBTC or ckETH or SNS DAO tokens. These trades are executed directly on-chain, providing full transparency and security.
- **Participate in DeFi:** Beyond simple trading, ICP’s DeFi ecosystem offers a range of opportunities, including yield farming, staking, and participating in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). By exploring these options, you can maximize the potential returns on your ICP tokens while contributing to the growth of the ecosystem.
- **Pariticipate in Decentralization Sale:** Users can also participate in SNS DAO Decentralization Sale, where dApp smart contracts are tokenized with a DAO Interface. You can buy SNS DAO tokens by contributing ICP to the sale via NNS Front End.
- **Staking via NNS:** You can create Neurons and sake $ICP tokens and SNS DAO tokens to vote on DAO proposals to earn voting reward.
- **MultiChain DeFi:** You can transfer your multi chain assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDC token to ICP network, wrap them to get ckBTC, ckETH or ckUSDC, and manage the digital twins on NNS. You can use these Multi Chain tokens on ICP DeFi too.


### ICP DeFi is Different Compared to Traditional DeFi

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on ICP is unique compared to other blockchain ecosystems. This is because of novel architecture of ICP and the unique tools and concepts such as Internet Identity and Network Nervous System.


### Unique Features of ICP
