A **proposal** in the context of a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** refers to a formal suggestion or decision point that the community can vote on to influence the future development and governance of a decentralized network.

On the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, proposals are submitted to the **Network Nervous System (NNS)**, which governs the blockchain and ensures that changes to the network are made in a decentralized and transparent manner.

These proposals can range from technical upgrades, policy decisions, and protocol changes to other critical aspects that shape the future of the ICP ecosystem.

DAOs emerged as a core concept within the blockchain space to allow for decentralized governance. Ethereum's early DAOs allowed token holders to submit and vote on governance decisions without centralized control.

ICP built on this by introducing the **NNS**, a DAO that manages the entire blockchain, making proposals essential for upgrading the protocol, adjusting parameters, and maintaining governance without a central authority.

Proposals in DAOs became particularly significant after the **2016 DAO hack** on Ethereum, highlighting both the power and the risks of decentralized governance.

The design of ICP’s NNS builds on these lessons by adding robust security, automation, and cryptographic safeguards to the proposal and voting processes.

**How Proposals Work:**

1. **Submission:** Any ICP user with enough **voting power** (through neurons) can submit a proposal to the NNS. The proposal contains the suggested change or action, which could be anything from a network upgrade, a policy change, or even economic adjustments like modifying tokenomics.
2. **Voting:** Once a proposal is submitted, ICP’s **neuron holders** (users who have staked ICP tokens in neurons) can vote either in favor or against it. Neurons with greater **voting power** (determined by the amount and duration of staked ICP tokens) carry more weight in the decision-making process.
3. **Liquid Democracy:** ICP’s governance model uses **liquid democracy**, meaning that neuron holders can choose to vote directly on proposals or delegate their voting power to trusted neurons. This allows for greater flexibility and ensures that even passive participants have their voting power represented.
4. **Decision:** The outcome of a proposal is determined by a majority vote, weighted by the voting power of the neurons. If a proposal is accepted, the **NNS** automatically executes the decision, making the process efficient and autonomous. For example, a technical upgrade proposal would be implemented directly by the network.
5. **Rewards:** Neuron holders are incentivized to vote on proposals through **governance rewards**. By participating in the decision-making process, they earn additional ICP tokens, which further incentivizes engagement and network security.

**Advantages of Proposals in DAO and NNS:**

- **Decentralized Control:** Proposals enable decentralized governance by allowing the community to shape the network’s future, reducing reliance on centralized authorities.
- **Transparency:** The entire proposal process is fully transparent and recorded on-chain, enabling anyone to audit the decision-making process.
- **Incentivized Participation:** By rewarding neuron holders for voting on proposals, ICP ensures active engagement in governance.
- **Autonomous Execution:** Once a proposal is approved, the NNS automatically executes it without manual intervention, making the governance process efficient and trustless.

**Practical Applications:**

- **Protocol Upgrades:** Proposals are used to introduce new features or upgrades to the ICP network, such as increasing transaction speed, adjusting the cost of cycles, or implementing changes to the **governance framework** itself.
- **dApp Upgrades:** Users can vote on proposals to upgrade dApps by using DAO frameworks such as Service Nervous System.
- **Treasury Management:** DAOs can securely and transparently manage their Treasury tokens by voting on Proposals that execute code changes.
- **Network Maintenance:** Proposals can be submitted to adjust various network parameters, such as transaction fees, staking requirements, and voting thresholds.
- **Policy Changes:** Major changes to how ICP handles governance, incentives, or development roadmaps can be introduced via proposals.
- **Economic Adjustments:** Proposals also enable modifications to ICP’s tokenomics, such as adjusting staking rewards or introducing new economic models to maintain network security.

**Example:**
In 2023, a proposal was submitted to upgrade the ICP protocol to improve smart contract efficiency. Neuron holders voted on this proposal, and upon its approval, the NNS automatically upgraded the network, enhancing the scalability and performance of canisters (ICP’s version of smart contracts). Another proposal was adopted in 2022 starting the development of ICP<>Bitcoin integration.

OpenChat holders vote on OpenChat SNS DAO proposals to upgrade the dApp or development of new features.

Proposals are the backbone of decentralized governance on ICP and other DAOs. As blockchain technology matures, the importance of decentralized proposals will grow, ensuring that these networks remain community-driven, secure, and adaptable.

The **NNS** represents the forefront of decentralized decision-making, offering a model that balances transparency, efficiency, and community participation.

**Further Exploration:**

- Explore how **liquid democracy** in ICP enhances user engagement through delegation.
- Investigate the process of submitting and voting on proposals through the **NNS dApp**.
- Compare the proposal mechanism in ICP with other DAOs, such as **MakerDAO** and **Ethereum’s DAO** governance systems.
