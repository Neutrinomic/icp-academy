**Cycles** are the **fuel of computation** (gas) on the Internet Computer.

They are consumed by **canisters** to pay for storage, memory, and execution of instructions. Cycles are not speculative tokens: they are stable resources that keep the network running.

**ICP tokens are burned to obtain Cycles**, which are measured in Trillion Cycles [1 Trillion Cycles = 1 XDR ~ 1.4 USD].

Traditional blockchains rely on **gas fees** to pay for execution. On Ethereum, gas prices fluctuate with network congestion, creating unpredictability for developers and users.  W

ICP redesigned this model. **1 Trillion cycles are pegged to 1 XDR** (an IMF-defined currency basket), ensuring predictable costs. This stability anchors ICP’s computation economy and shields developers from volatile transaction fees.

## How It Works

1. **Conversion**: ICP tokens are burned to create cycles.  
2. **Storage**: Cycles are deposited into canisters as their computational balance.  
3. **Consumption**: As canisters execute functions, cycles are deducted proportionally.  
4. **Expiration**: When a canister runs out of cycles, it becomes inactive until recharged.  

↯ **Stable valuation**: 1 trillion cycles = 1 XDR ~ 1.4 USD.  
↯ **Resource accounting**: cycles track memory, bandwidth, and compute instructions.  
↯ **Fuel model**: without cycles, no computation occurs on ICP.  

This system ensures canisters remain autonomous: they manage their own resources, independent of centralized providers.

## Advantages

↯ **Predictability**: Costs remain tied to XDR, not speculation.  
↯ **Efficiency**: Cycles are only spent when computation occurs.  
↯ **Sustainability**: Burning ICP to mint cycles stabilizes tokenomics.  
↯ **Autonomy**: Developers control application lifecycles directly through cycle management.  

For users, cycles mean **affordable and stable transaction fees**. For developers, they guarantee **cost control at scale**. For DAOs, cycles make resource use **transparent and predictable**, reinforcing sovereignty.

## Challenges and Risks

↯ **Cycle depletion**: If a canister runs out, it halts or freezes.  
↯ **Onboarding complexity**: Developers must manage ICP-to-cycle conversion.  
↯ **Economic pressure**: Poor cycle planning can drain resources quickly.  

ICP mitigates this with **management tools, dashboards, and automated refills**. Governance through the **NNS** can also adjust parameters if systemic risks arise, maintaining sustainability.

## Significancce of Cycles

↯ **Computation fuel**: Every dApp, from DeFi platforms to social networks, runs by consuming cycles.  
↯ **Resource metering**: Developers know exactly what storage or compute costs in cycle terms.  
↯ **Tokenomics anchor**: Cycles tie ICP utility to real-world value (1T = 1 XDR).  
↯ **Cross-chain operations**: ckBTC and other integrations consume cycles when verifying and executing external interactions.  

Cycles make ICP applications sovereign. A social dApp like **OpenChat** runs sustainably because its computation is priced in cycles. A DeFi protocol like **Neutrinite DAO** can measure treasury operations not in vague “gas” but in predictable cycles.  

↯ **Ethereum gas**: Unpredictable fees.  
↯ **Bitcoin transaction fees**: Fluctuate with demand.  
↯ **ICP cycles**: Pegged to XDR, ensuring stability.  

The contrast is clear: legacy chains make developers guess fees, while ICP ensures predictable economics. By anchoring computation to an external standard, ICP protocols remain both scalable and sustainable.

Cycles are the **lifeblood of the Internet Computer**. They turn ICP into real computation, giving canisters the ability to persist, scale, and govern themselves. Without cycles, applications cannot exist.  

On ICP, cycles are more than fees. They are **programmable fuel**: tied to real-world value, burned to stabilize supply, and consumed only when useful work is done. This model unites economics and computation into a predictable system.  

Where Ethereum relies on volatile gas, the Internet Computer runs on cycles that are **stable, sovereign, and future-proof**. With cycles, ICP proves that blockchain computation can be practical, affordable, and unstoppable.
