**ICRC (Internet Computer Request for Comments)** standards form the core framework for creating and managing digital assets on the Internet Computer (ICP).

They are equivalent to Ethereum’s ERC standards but are tailored for the unique architecture and capabilities of ICP. The ICRC standards ensure that tokens—whether fungible, non-fungible, or extended for specific functionalities—are interoperable, secure, and scalable across dapps on ICP.

ICRC standards specify how tokens function on the Internet Computer, covering everything from fungible and non-fungible tokens to more specialized asset-management functions. Each ICRC token follows rules that enable seamless operation across applications, enabling standardization and compatibility within ICP. The core ICRC standards include **ICRC-1** for fungible tokens, **ICRC-2** for delegated transfers, and **ICRC-7** for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

In 2022, the Network Nervous System (NNS) voted to adopt ICRC-1 as the official fungible token standard for ICP. Modeled after the general functionality of ERC-20, ICRC-1 was developed by the ICP community and the Ledger and Tokenization Technical Working Group.

It aimed to create a unified standard for digital assets across dapps, leading to additional standards like ICRC-2 and ICRC-7, which expanded the ecosystem’s versatility.

### How It Works

1. **ICRC-1 (Fungible Tokens)**: ICRC-1 defines the base functionality for fungible tokens, including token transfers, minting, burning, and metadata management (such as symbol, name, and decimals). Each ICRC-1 token uses an account structure based on a principal (user identifier) and optional subaccount for asset management, allowing multi-account handling under a single user identity.
2. **ICRC-2 (Approval and Transfer)**: This standard is an extension of ICRC-1 and introduces the “approve” and “transfer from” functions, allowing token holders to delegate spending to other users or services. This functionality is valuable for automatic payments or managed trading, as it enables recurring transactions without manual approval each time.
3. **ICRC-7 (Non-Fungible Tokens)**: For NFTs, ICRC-7 supports metadata for unique assets, including fields like symbol, name, description, and total supply. It mirrors the functionality of ICRC-1 for fungible tokens but is specifically designed to handle unique or limited-edition assets, such as digital collectibles or in-game items.

### Advantages

- **Interoperability**: ICRC tokens integrate across various dapps within the ICP ecosystem, providing a consistent user experience.
- **Scalability**: By standardizing token functions, ICRC improves scalability, allowing dapps to handle increasing transaction volumes with ease.
- **Security**: Each ICRC standard is NNS-approved, ensuring that tokens meet ICP’s security requirements and are compatible with its decentralized infrastructure.

### Practical Applications

- **Fungible Assets (ICRC-1)**: Used in governance, payments, or reward systems within dapps.
- **Automated Transactions (ICRC-2)**: Enables subscription models, managed wallets, or services requiring delegated transfers.
- **NFT Collections (ICRC-7)**: Allows creation of NFTs for art, collectibles, and virtual assets in gaming.

Tokens like **ckBTC** and **ckETH**, wrapped versions of Bitcoin and Ethereum, use ICRC-2 to enable trusted transactions within ICP dapps. For NFTs, developers are leveraging ICRC-7 to build unique asset collections, adding new dimensions to ICP’s decentralized applications.

ICRC standards make it possible to create diverse, interoperable digital assets on the Internet Computer, setting a strong foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and beyond. With ICRC-1’s fungibility, ICRC-2’s approvals, and ICRC-7’s NFT functionality, ICP is expanding its potential to support complex Web3 ecosystems.
