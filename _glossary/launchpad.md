A **launchpad** in the world of blockchain is a platform designed to help new projects launch their tokens, raise funds, and gain exposure in the crypto ecosystem. Think of it like a rocket launch site—but for crypto projects.

It provides the infrastructure, visibility, and early-stage funding that startups need to blast off successfully. For investors, a launchpad offers early access to new tokens at discounted rates before they’re listed on major exchanges.

In simple terms, a launchpad is a digital platform that facilitates **Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)**, **Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs)**, or **Initial NFT Offerings (INOs)**. These platforms serve as a bridge between blockchain startups and potential investors, creating a secure and efficient space for fundraising while reducing the risks associated with scams or low-quality projects.

On ICP there are several launchpads for token. The prominent launchpad being SNS aka Service Nervous System, which helps tokenize dApps on ICP and allows them to be governed by the community.

### How Launchpads Work

1. **Project Verification**: Blockchain projects apply to be listed on a launchpad. The platform conducts a rigorous vetting process to ensure legitimacy and feasibility, weeding out scams.
2. **Token Sales and Distribution**: Once approved, the project’s tokens are made available to investors on the launchpad. Early investors can buy these tokens, often at a lower price, before they’re publicly listed on exchanges.
3. **Community Building**: Launchpads help projects build a community by providing visibility and marketing support, attracting early adopters who are interested in supporting innovative ventures.

### Key Features

- **Security and Trust**: Launchpads mitigate risks by vetting projects, ensuring that only credible teams get listed. This adds a layer of trust for investors.
- **Early Access for Investors**: By participating in launchpads, investors can acquire tokens at discounted rates before they hit the open market, potentially leading to high returns.
- **Decentralized Participation**: Many launchpads operate on a decentralized basis, allowing anyone with access to the platform to participate in token sales, often through staking requirements or whitelist processes.

### Internet Computer’s (ICP) Launchpad Ecosystem

On the Internet Computer (ICP), launchpads facilitate the launch of decentralized projects, especially those leveraging ICP’s unique canister smart contracts. The combination of high throughput, low fees, and decentralized governance makes ICP launchpads an ideal choice for projects aiming to scale rapidly while maintaining decentralization.

- **SNS Launch**: The Service Nervous System (SNS) enables dapps to launch decentralized governance using ICP’s infrastructure, allowing projects to distribute governance tokens to their community through a decentralized swap mechanism. This model combines a launchpad’s token distribution with on-chain governance.

### Advantages

- **Reduced Entry Barriers**: Launchpads lower the technical and financial barriers for both startups and investors, democratizing access to new blockchain projects.
- **Fair Token Distribution**: Launchpads often use mechanisms like **whitelisting** and **lotteries** to ensure a fair distribution of tokens among participants, preventing whales from monopolizing early sales.
- **Community-Driven Growth**: By involving early supporters, projects can build a loyal community from day one, fostering organic growth.

**Practical Applications:**

- **DeFi Projects**: Decentralized Finance projects can use launchpads to gain early traction, raise funds, and bootstrap liquidity.
- **Gaming and NFTs**: GameFi projects and NFT collections can launch their tokens to the community, creating buzz and driving initial adoption.
- **DAO Governance Tokens**: Projects aiming for decentralized governance can distribute their DAO tokens via launchpads, ensuring fair participation and alignment with community interests.

Launchpads are crucial in the evolving crypto landscape, providing both projects and investors with a secure, structured way to kickstart new ventures. As the blockchain space matures, launchpads are expected to evolve, offering even more innovative ways to connect startups with supporters.
