The **Network Nervous System (NNS)** is the decentralized governance system of the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.

Operating as one of the largest and most autonomous DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) globally, the NNS manages all critical decisions about the Internet Computer, from protocol upgrades and economic policies to adding new node providers and subnets.

By staking ICP tokens in **neurons** and participating in voting, ICP token holders directly influence the blockchain's direction, making the NNS both a governance system and a decentralized brain that keeps ICP adaptive and community-driven.

The NNS is ICP’s central governance hub, enabling a truly decentralized approach to network control. It allows token holders to stake ICP and create neurons that grant them voting rights on proposals that shape the blockchain. Each neuron holds locked ICP tokens and is assigned voting power based on the amount staked, the length of the staking commitment (dissolve delay), and the neuron's maturity. Voting power in the NNS reflects a staker’s commitment to the long-term health and security of the Internet Computer.

### How NNS Works

1. **Neuron Creation and Staking**: ICP holders create neurons by locking up ICP tokens for a specified dissolve delay. This delay can be set from a few months to multiple years, with longer delays resulting in more voting power and greater rewards.
2. **Proposals and Voting**: Any neuron holder can submit a proposal for network upgrades, economic changes, or new features. Neurons then vote on these proposals, with each vote weighted by voting power. Proposals require a majority to pass, and decisions are automatically executed on-chain once approved.
3. **Liquid Democracy Model**: The NNS supports a “liquid democracy” approach, where neurons can delegate their voting power to other neurons. This allows users to vote directly or delegate their votes to trusted community members on specific topics, ensuring that expert opinions help shape key decisions.
4. **Rewards and Maturity**: Neurons earn rewards for participating in governance. Rewards accumulate as "maturity," which can be converted into additional ICP tokens or used to increase voting power. Maturity aligns the incentives of token holders with the network’s health, encouraging active, long-term participation.

### Advantages

- **Fully Decentralized Governance**: Decisions are made by the community, creating a transparent, adaptive, and community-led network.
- **Secure and Adaptive**: The NNS autonomously manages network upgrades and adjusts the protocol based on community consensus, keeping ICP updated without the need for centralized intervention.
- **Incentives for Participation**: The reward structure encourages active participation in governance, aligning the community’s interests with the long-term success of the Internet Computer.

### Practical Applications

- **Protocol Upgrades**: The NNS approves upgrades to improve performance, security, and new features.
- **Economic Policy**: The NNS governs economic parameters like staking rewards, network fees, and ICP token economics.
- **Subnet and Node Management**: The NNS is responsible for adding new nodes and subnets, determining the geographic diversity and scalability of the network.
- **Everything Related to ICP**: NNS can make any changes to the ICP network. The token holders can vote on any proposals to make any changes to the ICP Blockchain.

Through the NNS, the ICP community recently approved a proposal to integrate with Bitcoin, allowing direct interactions between ICP and the Bitcoin blockchain. This illustrates the NNS’s role in enhancing cross-chain functionality, driving the Internet Computer’s capabilities forward through community consensus.

The NNS represents a powerful model for blockchain governance, balancing decentralized control with active community participation. Its unique structure as a liquid democracy ensures that expertise guides decisions, with incentives that foster a long-term commitment to the network's health. As the Internet Computer evolves, the NNS is expected to support more decentralized applications, ensuring the ICP ecosystem remains robust and innovative.
