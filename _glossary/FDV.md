**Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)** represents the total value of a cryptocurrency or token if all possible tokens, including those yet to be issued or unlocked, were in circulation at the current market price.

FDV is calculated by multiplying the maximum supply of tokens (assuming all tokens are issued or unlocked) by the current token price. This metric gives investors and participants an idea of the potential market cap once all tokens have been distributed, offering a broader perspective of a project's full market potential.

The concept of FDV became particularly important with the rise of **initial coin offerings (ICOs)** and **token sales**, where projects often issued tokens in stages with vesting schedules for team members, investors, or contributors. While the circulating supply of tokens might only represent a fraction of the total supply early on, FDV provides a forward-looking estimate of the total value if all tokens were fully liquid.

As DeFi and tokenomics grew more complex, understanding FDV became crucial for evaluating projects with long-term vesting or large locked reserves, such as those in decentralized governance or yield farming protocols.

**How FDV is Calculated:**

1. **Current Market Price:**
    - FDV uses the **current price** of a token in circulation. This is typically the price on a major exchange or decentralized platform where the token is actively traded.
2. **Total Supply:**
    - FDV is based on the **maximum total supply** of a token, including both circulating and non-circulating tokens. This includes tokens locked in smart contracts, reserved for future use, or vested over time.
3. **Formula:** FDV is calculated using the formula

    FDV = {Current Price} x {Total Max Supply}

    For example, if a token is trading at $5 and its maximum supply is 1 billion tokens, the FDV would be $5 billion.

**Advantages of FDV:**

- **Long-Term Valuation Insight:**

    FDV offers a glimpse into the **long-term potential** of a token’s market cap. It helps investors understand the total valuation of a project once all tokens are fully unlocked and in circulation.

- **Transparency in Tokenomics:**

    By focusing on FDV, projects can provide **transparency** regarding their token supply and distribution schedules. This allows participants to gauge the impact of upcoming token unlocks on market value and circulating supply.

- **Strategic Investment Decisions:**

    For investors, FDV helps in **identifying overvalued or undervalued tokens** by comparing current market cap to fully diluted figures. Projects with a high FDV relative to their circulating supply might face significant inflationary pressure, affecting the token price over time.

**Challenges and Risks:**

1. **Misleading Valuation:**
    - FDV can sometimes paint an **overly optimistic picture** of a project’s value. A high FDV might suggest a project’s potential market cap is enormous, but it does not account for the risk of token dilution or market dynamics that could depress the price as more tokens are unlocked.
2. **Supply Inflation and Token Dilution:**
    - When tokens are gradually released into circulation, they can cause **supply inflation**, potentially diluting the value of tokens already held by investors. If the market cannot absorb the new supply, it can lead to downward pressure on the token price.
3. **Vesting and Unlock Risks:**
    - Projects with long **vesting schedules** or large future unlock events may see sudden price swings when a large portion of tokens enters the market. Investors need to factor in the timing of these events when assessing FDV.

**Practical Applications and Use Cases:**

1. **ICO and Token Sale Valuations:**
    - FDV is frequently used during token sales or ICOs to provide a full picture of the project’s valuation. While the circulating supply might be low early on, FDV helps investors gauge the **true valuation** if all tokens were available.
2. **DeFi Governance Tokens:**
    - DeFi protocols often issue governance tokens with **vesting schedules** for early contributors, developers, or investors. FDV becomes a critical metric in these scenarios, helping stakeholders understand the long-term value of the governance token once all tokens are vested.
3. **Portfolio Management:**
    - Investors and funds managing large portfolios often use FDV to compare projects at different stages of their tokenomics life cycle. Projects with high FDV and low circulating supply may present **higher risk** due to potential token unlocks.

Consider a DeFi project with a circulating supply of 10 million tokens, trading at $10 each, giving it a circulating market cap of $100 million. However, if the total maximum supply is 100 million tokens (including tokens reserved for the team and future development), the **FDV** would be $1 billion. This FDV helps investors understand the long-term value implications of future token unlocks and how they might affect the price.

FDV is a crucial metric for evaluating the long-term value and potential risks of crypto projects, particularly those with staggered token releases or inflationary tokenomics. As DeFi and tokenized ecosystems continue to grow, FDV will remain a key tool for investors seeking to make informed decisions in an increasingly complex market. With innovations like **ICP’s transparent governance and token vesting**, the future of FDV could involve more real-time, on-chain metrics, providing even deeper insight into a project’s potential.
