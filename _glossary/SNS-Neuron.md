An **SNS Neuron** is a fundamental staking unit within the DAO governance system of a Service Nervous System (SNS) on ICP. Users can create an SNS Neurons by staking SNS tokens.

Neurons represent staked governance power, allowing users to participate actively in the decisions that shape a decentralized application (dapp) governed by an SNS. Each neuron holds staked tokens, giving users voting power and influence within the SNS.

In the context of SNS governance, a neuron is a virtual entity created when users lock (or "stake") their SNS tokens for a defined period.

The staking process enables users to vote on governance proposals, contribute to discussions, and, in some cases, even submit their own proposals for changes in the dapp’s development or policies. The longer the tokens are staked, the more voting power the neuron accumulates, promoting sustained commitment from the community.

### How SNS Neurons Work

1. **Creating a Neuron**: Users create a neuron by staking their SNS tokens within the SNS governance framework. This process locks the tokens for a specified duration, and the neuron remains active until the tokens are unstaked. Voting power is influenced by the number of tokens staked and the length of the staking period.
2. **Voting Mechanism**: Neurons represent voting power within SNS governance. When a proposal is introduced—whether it's a feature update, policy change, or budget allocation—each neuron votes based on its staked amount and length, giving committed users a stronger voice in decisions. Neurons can also delegate voting power to other trusted users, enabling a flexible and community-driven approach to governance.
3. **Dissolution Delay**: The neuron’s dissolve delay is the minimum time it takes to unlock staked tokens. The longer the dissolve delay, the more voting power a neuron gains. This encourages users to take long-term stakes in governance, promoting stability and thoughtful decision-making within the community.
4. **Proposal Creation and Adoption**: Neurons enable users to both submit and vote on proposals within the SNS. When a proposal gains sufficient support, the SNS governance system executes the change autonomously, reflecting the community’s decisions directly on-chain without developer intervention.

### Advantages

- **Stake-Based Governance**: Neurons align voting power with stake size and duration, giving more influence to users with long-term commitments to the dapp’s success.
- **Delegated Voting**: Neurons can delegate voting to others, creating flexibility and allowing specialized members to make informed decisions on behalf of others.
- **Autonomous Execution**: Once a proposal is approved by the neuron community, the SNS governance canister automatically executes the decision, ensuring governance remains transparent and user-led.

### Practical Example

In **OpenChat**, a social application on ICP, SNS neurons empower the $CHAT token holders to vote on platform developments, feature implementations, and policy adjustments. Neuron holders stake their tokens and engage in proposals, helping to guide the app’s growth and operations in a truly decentralized manner.

On the Internet Computer, SNS neurons operate under a robust governance structure, safeguarded by the Network Nervous System (NNS). Neurons allow stakeholders to vote with confidence that all governance decisions align with ICP’s security and reliability standards, making neuron-based governance a secure and transparent experience.

SNS Neurons offer a practical model for decentralized governance on ICP, allowing communities to manage and guide their dapps in a participatory, democratic way. By staking tokens and voting within SNS governance, users directly influence the future of the applications they care about.
