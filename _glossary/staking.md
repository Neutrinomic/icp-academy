**Staking** is the act of locking up cryptocurrency tokens in a blockchain network to support its operations, such as validating transactions and securing the network. In return, stakers earn rewards, usually in the form of additional tokens.

This is a core feature of **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** and similar mechanisms, where token holders provide the necessary resources to maintain the network, rather than relying on energy-intensive mining like **Proof-of-Work** systems.

Staking enables token holders to participate in network validation and governance without the high energy costs of mining. Validators (selected based on the amount of tokens staked) confirm transactions and create new blocks, receiving rewards proportional to their stake. This process not only secures the blockchain but also incentivizes users to act honestly—any malicious actions can lead to penalties or "slashing" of their staked tokens.

### How Staking Works

1. **Token Lockup**: Stakers commit their tokens to the network, locking them in a smart contract for a specified period. The amount staked often impacts the validator selection process, with larger stakes offering greater chances of being selected.
2. **Validation and Rewards**: Validators are chosen from the pool of stakers to confirm transactions and add new blocks. For their efforts, they receive rewards, which vary based on the network and staking duration.
3. **Unstaking**: After the staking period, users can "unstake" their tokens. Some networks impose penalties or reduced rewards for early withdrawals, while others have fixed lock-up periods.

### ICP Staking with the Network Nervous System (NNS)

On the Internet Computer (ICP), staking is unique and takes place within the **Network Nervous System (NNS)**, ICP's on-chain governance system. ICP token holders can stake their tokens by creating **neurons**, which represent locked tokens in the NNS. Neurons give holders governance rights, enabling them to vote on proposals that shape the future of the ICP blockchain. Here's how ICP staking differs:

- **Neuron Creation**: When ICP holders stake tokens, they lock them into neurons for a specified dissolve delay, influencing voting power and rewards. Neurons with longer dissolve delays earn higher rewards, promoting long-term commitment.
- **Governance and Rewards**: Neurons participate in governance by voting on proposals. In return, they earn rewards based on their activity, with rewards accumulating as “maturity,” which can be converted into liquid ICP or used to grow the neuron.
- **Dissolve Delay**: ICP neurons have a flexible dissolve delay, which stakers can set to match their commitment. Longer dissolve delays yield higher rewards but require a longer waiting period before tokens can be unstaked.

ICP staking through neurons offers a unique model by combining governance and rewards, aligning the network's development with the interests of its stakeholders.

### Advantages

- **Passive Income**: Stakers earn rewards by committing their tokens, similar to earning interest.
- **Network Security**: Staking incentivizes participants to protect the network by tying their assets to its health.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Staking is less energy-intensive than mining, making it a sustainable alternative for network security.

### Practical Applications

- **Ethereum**: With Ethereum’s transition to PoS, ETH holders can stake their tokens and earn rewards, participating in network security and governance.
- **ICP**: By staking in neurons on the NNS, ICP holders actively shape network upgrades, economic policies, and more.
- **Tezos and Polkadot**: These networks also use PoS mechanisms, allowing users to stake tokens and earn rewards while contributing to network security.

Staking continues to gain popularity as blockchains move toward PoS models, enabling token holders to earn rewards while participating in governance. With unique models like ICP’s neuron-based governance, staking is evolving to include active community engagement, providing both financial benefits and influence over network direction.
